2.  ## Test items  

3.  ## Features to be tested  

4.  ## Features not to be tested  

5.  ## Approach  

>    Testing for the library itself will be conducted in three stages and can be completed exclusively in automated testing.  The stages of tests are as follows: 
> 1.  Component testing will test the classes in the project.  In the component testing phase white-box testing techniques will be used, namely control flow diagrams.
>
> 2.  Integration testing will be used to test subsystems within the project.  (i.e. key compiling/destructuring)
>
> 3.  Validation/System testing will test specific features of the library.  Concrete implementations will be tested in this phase to  ensure each format is serialized and deserialized according to specification.
