 1. ## Approach  
   Testing for the library itself will be conducted in three stages and can be completed exclusively in automated testing.  The stages of tests are as follows: 
   1. Component testing will test the classes in the project.  In the component testing phase white-box testing techniques will be used, namely control flow diagrams.
   2. Integration testing will be used to test subsystems within the project.  (i.e. key compiling/destructuring)
   3. Validation/System testing will test specific features of the library.  Concrete implementations will be tested in this phase to  ensure each format is serialized and deserialized according to specification.
